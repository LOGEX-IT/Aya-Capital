            The project to create a coal complex in Salkadamna is part of the energy policy of the government of Niger, which aims to increase the country's energy capacity in order to achieve energy independence. The first part of the project is to compensate for the limited access of the Nigerien population to modern energies and to respond to a growing demand for energy which is estimated at 2,615 GWH in 2020 and 6,434 GWH in 2030 compared to 1557 GWH in 2015. The Salkadamna mining site has an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes of coal (lignite) with current reserves estimated at 69 million tonnes. The energy produced from the thermal power station will be 200 MW in four 50 MW units and transmission will be on a 330 KV line for about 400 KM between Salkadamna and Niamey and another 132 KV line for about 200 KM between Salkadamna - Tahoua - Malbaza. In a second phase, it would be to manufacture mineral charcoal briquettes for domestic use as a substitute for wood to reduce deforestation.
