            In Niger, there is a great disparity in the rate of access to modern energy services between the different zones. Indeed, the percentage of rural electrification is 0.27% against 48.12% in urban areas and 9.04% nationally according to data from the National Institute of Statistics. To reduce the inequitable energy supply observed for more than fifty years, the State of Niger plans to install 15,000 street lights and 2,500 solar optical lights in rural areas of Niger. This project is part of the President of the Republic's Renaissance II Program, which aims to address the energy deficit in several outlying districts of Niamey.
