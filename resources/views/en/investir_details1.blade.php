            SONICHAR (Nigerian coal company of Anou - Araren) aims to draw up an assessment of the current prospects (increase in their production) of the mining customers of SONICHAR to which are added the growing needs of NIGELEC, the national electricity operator as well as than the development of new mines in the region (GOVIEX, GLOBALE ATOMIC) which shows a deficit in installed capacity from 2013. To compensate for this shortfall in peak power coverage and sustain the supply of electrical energy to the northern region from the country. SONICHAR must be equipped with an electrical energy production tool in line with its new needs, with the addition to the current complex of a second power station with two 25 MW units; because SONICHAR has an additional requirement of 42 MW (excluding new customers) while it can only cover 32 MW.
