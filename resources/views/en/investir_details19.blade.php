           It is noted, in rural areas, a high rate of absenteeism and abandonment of teachers and nurses who always prefer to serve in better living conditions (urban and semi-urban centers); this results in the drop in the level of education of the pupils, the precariousness and the lack of appropriate care for the rural populations. To minimize these negative effects, this project proposes initiatives that should help improve the living conditions of officials and other professionally affected actors in peri-urban and rural areas. The idea here is to provide them with solar kits for lighting, ventilation, communication, television, etc. ; by creating special conditions for access to its kits based on their income.
