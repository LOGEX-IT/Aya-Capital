            This project aims to create a financial institution specializing in furniture and real estate leasing in Niamey. The lease has the particularity of allowing companies but also individuals to invest in material goods in the form of simple rental or rental with the possibility of repurchase for a period fixed in advance. The project is part of the government policy which aims to develop this mode of financing since the adoption in August 2017 of an ordinance legally framing the credit lease in Niger.
