           This project is part of the pursuit of the policy of financial inclusion through ICTs in Niger. The central objective of the project is to accelerate the financial inclusion of populations to go from a 4% banking rate to at least 27%, which will be possible thanks to this platform that we want to set up. Thus, we want to offer innovative financial services (mobile wallet, Savings-Tontine, Account-to-account transfer, etc.), modern and local, to meet demand in order to consolidate the socio-economic development of the country. thanks to the largest financial network in NIGER with NIGER POSTE (more than 92 points of contact and in 2018 more than 150)
