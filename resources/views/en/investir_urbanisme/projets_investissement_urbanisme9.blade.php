         Niamey, the capital of Niger, is experiencing sustained population growth and increasing in size. This growth is giving rise to new needs in terms of infrastructure and services, in particular in the water and sanitation sector in the outskirts of the city. Indeed, Niger is lagging far behind in terms of infrastructure for direct connection of dwellings to gutters as well as wastewater treatment plants. Thousands of people suffer every day from diseases caused by poor sanitation such as diarrheal diseases, malaria, debilitating intestinal parasitic infections and other diseases caused by insects
