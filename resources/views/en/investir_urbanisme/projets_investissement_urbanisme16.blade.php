            The Nigerien market is inundated with carbonated drinks from various walks of life. Most of these drinks are made from synthetic products which can be harmful to health. The objective of the project is the creation of a unit for processing fruit into natural juice in Niamey. Niger is indeed a major producer of mango, tamarind, A1: K11 and hibiscus; products that can be used to produce good quality natural juice that meet the expectations of both domestic and international consumers.
