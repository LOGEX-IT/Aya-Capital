            Since 2000, the Nigerien cement market has experienced average annual growth of + 10% and its national production only covers 20%. Niger, which has a low cement production capacity and imports nearly 70% of its annual needs from neighboring countries. With a production of 950,000 tons, the New Garadawa Cement Plant will largely cover the country's needs, it will lower the price per ton of cement, which has continued to increase over the years and provide decent housing to affordable prices. This project is part of the policy to revive Niger's economic activity through the development of natural resources to supply the Nigerien markets with cement.
