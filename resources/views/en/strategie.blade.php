              We ourselves, entrepreneurs, are involved on a daily basis in the management and turnaround of companies in which we are shareholders. It is these personal experiences, these successes but also these failures that nourish our listening skills and our great ability to understand new or complex environments.<br></br>

              We think with you about an intelligent structuring of your financing in order to preserve your professional heritage and optimize the financial structure of your company.<br></br>

              We think of our consulting practice as an exchange between peers. Our primary role is to create around you a context favorable to the emergence of ideas, solutions and a climate of strength and serenity. This is what will allow us, together, to design and take on strategic decisions.<br></br>

              <h3><b>Personalized support</b></h3>
