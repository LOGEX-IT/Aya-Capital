            The project to build a thermal oil-fired power station with a production capacity of 75 MW in the Zinder region aims to overcome the region's recurring deficit in electrical energy through the exploitation of oil resources in abundance in Niger; which explains the relevance of the project. The implementation of the project will increase national coverage, improve the quality of the electrical power supply to the areas served and contribute to the strengthening of the socio-economic development of the regions of the Center-East of Niger.

            <b>Benefits</b><br>
            <ul style="margin: 15px 15px;">
              <li>This technology offers great flexibility of use which makes it possible to respond quickly and efficiently to the growing demand that the supply resulting from the interconnection with Nigeria cannot meet;</li>
              <li>Relatively short construction and operation times of the plant;</li>
              <li>Rationalization of production costs: site located near the Zinder refinery for a better supply of fuel oil and existence of high voltage lines for the evacuation of energy;</li>
              <li>Abundance of water from the site's groundwater for cooling the turbine in order to optimize hydrocarbon consumption.</li>
            </ul>
